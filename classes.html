            <h3>Gentle Hatha Yoga</h3>
            <p>
                Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the
                practice of yoga, this 60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses
                on asana (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and
                guided meditation to foster your mind and body connection.

            <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
            <p>
                Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are
                welcome to sample this 60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized
                movementâ€”you will inhale and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga
                poses.

            <h3>Restorative Yoga</h3>
            <p>
                This 90 minute class features very slow movement and long poses that are
                supported by a chair or wall. This calming, restorative experience is
                suitable for students of any level of experience. This practice can be a
                perfect way to help rehabilitate an injury.

        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your
            side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into
            the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side
            and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs.
            Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life.
            Namaste.</p>
